## Hello 👋

I'm Stu, a coffee lover ☕, 30-something-year-old **front-end developer** 💻 with a background in computer and electrical engineering. I am based out of sunny ☀️ Edinburgh, Scotland and currently doing freelance work and consulting for international clients.

I started creating cool web designs using HTML and CSS back in 2006. I am JavaScript enthusiast and extremely passionate about coding. I love to learn new things every day and keep up with the new technologies. In many ways, websites and apps are my first love. 🧡

Last but not least, one of my favorite actuvutes is to educate and mentor others in the field to fulfill their potential and deepen my knowledge. You can find out more on my YouTube Channel.
